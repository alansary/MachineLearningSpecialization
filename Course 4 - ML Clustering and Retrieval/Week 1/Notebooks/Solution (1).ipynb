    "Some observations:\n",
    "* As we increase the search radius, we find more neighbors that are a smaller distance away.\n",
    "* With increased search radius comes a greater number documents that have to be searched. Query time is higher as a consequence.\n",

    "**Quiz Question**. Suppose our goal was to produce 10 approximate nearest neighbors whose average distance from the query document is within 0.01 of the average for the true 10 nearest neighbors. For Barack Obama, the true 10 nearest neighbors are on average about 0.77. What was the smallest search radius for Barack Obama that produced an average distance of 0.78 or better? 7"
