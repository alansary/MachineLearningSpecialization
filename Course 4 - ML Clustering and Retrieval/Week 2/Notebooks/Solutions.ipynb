    "**Quiz Question**. Another way to capture the effect of changing initialization is to look at the distribution of cluster assignments. Add a line to the code above to compute the size (# of member data points) of clusters for each run of k-means. Look at the size of the largest cluster (most # of member data points) across multiple runs, with seeds 0, 20000, ..., 120000. How much does this measure vary across the runs? What is the minimum and maximum values this quantity takes?\n",
